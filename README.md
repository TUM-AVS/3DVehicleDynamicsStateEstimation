This repository provides a 3D Point-Mass-based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for the estimation of the vehicle pose (position and orientation) and velocity. The approach is extended by additionally fusing the velocity estimates of a Single-Track-Model-based Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).

## Introduction

Within the field of autonomous driving a reliable pose and velocity estimate has to be ensured at all times. Therefore, a Point-Mass-based EKF is chosen to ensure numerical stability and independence of vehicle and tire parameters. The estimation is seperated in a 2D and a 3D approach. The advantages of a 3D estimate are demonstrated in the associated paper linked below. To improve the estimation, reference angles as well as virtual velocity measurements are introduced. The best results in our study have been achieved by calculating the virtual velocity input with a Single-Track-Model-based UKF. More information about the overall concept as well as a benchmark study can be found in the paper. An overview of the estimation concept is shown in the figure below.

![High Level state estimation concept](/docs/images/repository_structure.png "High Level state estimation concept")

The implemented [state estimation](/lib_cpp/state_estimation_cpp/include/state_estimation_cpp) provides a modular interface for N localization inputs (GNSS or SLAM), N velocity inputs (virtual measurement, optical sensor, wheelspeed encoders) and N IMUs. All classes are templated with configurations using [structs](/lib_cpp/constants/state_estimation_constants/include/state_estimation_constants/) to enable the use of various filter approaches (e.g. 2D, 3D) within the same [node](/packages_cpp/state_estimation_node_cpp/).

The [side slip angle estimation](/lib_cpp/ssa_estimation_cpp/include/ssa_estimation_cpp) is templated as well using [structs](/lib_cpp/constants/ssa_estimation_constants/include/ssa_estimation_constants/). This enables extensions for tire parameter estimation or similar, whilst using the same [node](/packages_cpp/ssa_estimation_node_cpp/).

Both estimators use the [IMU Handler](/lib_cpp/base/imu_handler/include/imu_handler) as well as the [Finite Impulse Response Filter](/lib_cpp/base/classical_filter/include/classical_filter) for bias correction, averaging and prefiltering of the IMU measurements.

## Message definitions

We utilize the following signal names for the ROS2-Nodes. The messages have to be defined accordingly or the implementations of the node subscriptions in /packages_cpp have to be adapted accordingly.

### IMU 
- names: /vehicle/sensor/imu1, /vehicle/sensor/imu2, /vehicle/sensor/imu3
- type: sensor_msgs::msg::Imu
- note: already transformed to COG

### GPS
Odometry:
- names: /vehicle/sensor/odometry1, /vehicle/sensor/odometry2, /vehicle/sensor/odometry3
- type: nav_msgs::msg::Odometry
- note: transformed to COG from its frame_id based on [urdf](/packages_cpp/state_publisher/urdf/urdf.xml)

Status:
- status: /vehicle/sensor/status1, /vehicle/sensor/status2, /vehicle/sensor/status3
- type: diagnostic_msgs::msg::DiagnosticStatus
- note: has to be valid to fuse the GPS input

### Wheelspeed
Wheelspeed:
- name: /vehicle/sensor/wheelspeed_radps
- type: msgs::msg::TUMFloat64PerWheelStamped

Status:
- name: /vehicle/sensor/wheelspeed_status
- type: diagnostic_msgs::msg::DiagnosticStatus

## Running the Code

To run the code make sure having ROS2 installed - the code was developed and tested using ROS2-Humble.

### Run locally

Build the required ROS-Nodes using colcon and source the install folder in each used terminal:

```bash
colcon build
source ./install/setup.bash
```

If the build process requires too much RAM, use the following command to limit the load average and thus the number of processes before the build command (for Unix-like operating systems):

```bash
export MAKEFLAGS="-l2.5"
```

The nodes can be launched using the following commands:

State Publisher - Publishes the required transformations from Antenna Position to COG:

```bash
ros2 launch state_publisher state_publisher.py
```

State Estimation:

- 2D:

```bash
ros2 run state_estimation_node_cpp state_estimation_node_cpp_ekf_2d_kin --ros-args --params-file config/state_estimation_cpp_2d_ekf_config.yml
```

- 3D:

```bash
ros2 run state_estimation_node_cpp state_estimation_node_cpp_ekf_3d_kin --ros-args --params-file config/state_estimation_cpp_3d_ekf_config.yml
```

To launch different vehicle models altnerate kin (kinematic) to nh (non-holonomic) or stm (kinematic single track model). Those provide different configurations of the vehicle handler and, thus, different virtual velocity inputs.

Side Slip Angle Estimation:

```bash
ros2 run ssa_estimation_node_cpp ssa_estimation_node --ros-args --params-file config/ssa_estimation_ukf_config.yml
```

Example Bag (note that the msgs have to be sourced in this terminal):

```bash
ros2 bag play vegas24_pub
```

### Docker

Build Dockerimage:

```bash
. docker/build_docker.sh
```

Run Containers:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose-file.yml up
```

### Remarks

Note that each estimator has to be tuned accordingly utilizing the config files. The current implementation shows a fine tuning of state and side slip angle estimation for the example bag considering the kinemaic 3D-EKF and the Side Slip Angle Estimator are both launched.
Currently no road angle map is implemented in the published version. Therefore, the 2D-EKF does not show accurate estimations for the provided example bag due to the high banking angles. Addiotional road maps could be fused by adding an additional sensor subscription and utilizing the `update_road_angles(odometry)` function in the state estimation implementation. The status is currently set to Warning as no subscription is implemented. 

To launch the kinematic State Estimation without the Side Slip Angle Estimation the parameter `P_VDC_InitializeWithVelocity` has to be set to false in the config file.
